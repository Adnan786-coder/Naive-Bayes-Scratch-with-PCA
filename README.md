Naive Bayes Classifier (From Scratch) with PCA

Overview
This project implements a Naive Bayes Classifier completely from scratch, combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The purpose is to understand the mathematical concepts and coding logic behind Naive Bayes and PCA without using built-in machine learning libraries.
